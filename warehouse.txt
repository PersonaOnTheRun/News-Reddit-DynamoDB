For anyone unfamiliar, Andromeda seems to be the \\r\\nreplacement for both Android and Chrome OS (cue endless debates over the \\r\\nsemantics of that, and what it all entails). Fuchsia is the actual name of \\r\\nthe operating system, while Magenta is the name of the kernel, or more \\r\\ncorrectly, the microkernel. Many of the architectural design decisions \\r\\nappear to have unsurprisingly been focused on creating a highly scalable \\r\\nplatform.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt goes without saying that Google isn\\u2019t trying to hide Fuchsia. People \\r\\nhave clearly discovered that Google is replacing Android\\u2019s Linux kernel. \\r\\nStill, I thought it would be interesting for people to get a better sense \\r\\nof what the OS actually is. This article is only intended to be an overview \\r\\nof the basics, as far as I can comment reasonably competently. (I certainly \\r\\nnever took an operating systems class!)\\r\\n\\r\\nTo my naive eyes, rather than saying Chrome OS is being merged into \\r\\nAndroid, it looks more like Android and Chrome OS are both being merged \\r\\ninto Fuchsia. It\\u2019s worth noting that these operating systems had previously \\r\\nalready begun to merge together to an extent, such as when the Android team \\r\\nworked with the Chrome OS team in order to bring Update Engine to Nougat, \\r\\nwhich introduced A/B updates to the platform.\\r\\n\\r\\nGoogle is unsurprisingly bringing up Andromeda on a number of platforms, \\r\\nincluding the humble Intel NUC. ARM, x86, and MIPS bring-up is exactly what \\r\\nyou would expect for an Android successor, and it also seems clear that \\r\\nthis platform will run on Intel laptops. More on this later.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy best guess is that Android as an API and runtime will live on as a \\r\\nlegacy environment within Andromeda. That\\u2019s not to say that all development \\r\\nof Android would immediately stop, which seems extremely unlikely. But \\r\\nGoogle can\\u2019t push two UI APIs as equal app frameworks over the long term: \\r\\nMojo is clearly the future.\\r\\n\\r\\nAh, but what is Mojo? Well it\\u2019s the new API for writing Andromeda apps, and \\r\\nit comes from Chromium. Mojo was originally created to \\u201cextract a common \\r\\nplatform out of Chrome's renderer and plugin processes that can support \\r\\nmultiple types of sandboxed content.\\u201d\\u00a0It seems to have enabled Android apps \\r\\nin Chrome OS, and now it will serve an even more extensive role as the \\r\\ndeveloper API for Andromeda. (Sidenote: as far as I can tell, Native Client \\r\\nis well and truly dead. Pour one out for the valiant effort that was NaCl.)\\r\\n\\r\\nMojo in Fuchsia features intriguingly extensive language support. C/C++, \\r\\nDart, Go, Java, Python, and Rust are all first-class citizens of the \\r\\nplatform. I am guessing that C/C++ is for native development, Go is for \\r\\nnetworking, Java is for Android, Python is for scripting, and Rust is for \\r\\nwriting portions of the kernel. Mixing and matching languages aside, the \\r\\nmain UI API is based on, yes, Dart.\\r\\n\\r\\nFlutter was an existing Google widget framework for apps written in Dart, \\r\\nand it has been repurposed to become the UI framework for Andromeda. \\r\\nFlutter includes a series of Material Design widgets and was engineered to \\r\\nrender apps up to 120fps.*\\u00a0I imagine Andromeda\\u2019s standard UI components \\r\\nwill look similar if not identical to those of Android. A physically based \\r\\nrenderer, Escher, is apparently being used to render, well, material \\r\\nelements and perhaps shadows in a high quality manner.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have very strong reservations about Dart as the language of the primary \\r\\nplatform API, but it\\u2019s best to wait for the fully revealed details before \\r\\nforming an opinion. The reason for Dart is obvious, however: to enable a \\r\\ncross-platform app framework. The pitch will clearly be that developers can \\r\\nwrite a Flutter app once and have it run on Andromeda, Android, and iOS \\r\\nwith minimal extra work, in theory. (Flutter does not target the web.) Even \\r\\nif Andromeda is its full replacement, Android will be a separate developer \\r\\ntarget for many years given its gigantic installed base.\\r\\n\\r\\nAndromeda's actual app runtime is called Modular, \\u201ca post-API programming \\r\\nmodel that allows applications to cooperate in a shared context without the \\r\\nneed to call each other's APIs directly.\\\" To do this it uses Mojo \\r\\ninter-process communication (IPC) messages, which are exchanged via \\r\\nlow-level primitives in the form of message pipes (small amounts of data), \\r\\ndata pipes (large amounts of data), and shared buffers.\\r\\n\\r\\nI'm not technically knowledgeable enough to understand how the various \\r\\nlanguages interface over these IPC calls, and what exactly that enables. \\r\\nThe IDL used is the Fuchsia Interface Description Language (FIDL),\\u00a0\\u201can \\r\\nencoding format used to describe [Mojo] interfaces to be used on top of \\r\\nMagenta message pipes. They are the standard way applications talk to each \\r\\nother in Fuchsia.\\u201d\\u00a0Right now at least, only C/C++, Dart, and Go have \\r\\nsupported bindings. Dart is thus the main platform language. (My \\r\\nunderstanding is that Go is not exactly ideal for writing UI apps.)\\r\\n\\r\\nWhy Andromeda?\\r\\n\\r\\nObservers have naturally wondered for years if Google would ever unify \\r\\nAndroid and Chrome OS, in line with Sundar's obvious desires. Despite some \\r\\nquestionable half-measures along the way, this will now finally take \\r\\nplace.\\u00a0Andromeda will immensely help Google bring together and unify a \\r\\nbroad array of in-house technologies, beyond just its two consumer OSes.\\r\\n\\r\\nAndromeda clearly serves Google\\u2019s own purposes.\\u00a0The only platforms that the \\r\\ncompany really supports are the web, Android, and iOS, in that order. I \\r\\nthink Windows support is effectively limited to Chrome at this point. \\r\\nFlutter exactly exemplifies this strategy.\\u00a0Google will no longer have to \\r\\nfield separate Android and iOS apps and teams, and can now greatly focus \\r\\nits app development efforts.\\u00a0\\\"More wood behind fewer arrows,\\\" in other \\r\\nwords.\\r\\n\\r\\nObservations:\\r\\n\\r\\nAs you would expect, Google submitted patches for Fuchsia to both LLVM and \\r\\nGCC.\\r\\n\\r\\nInterestingly web rendering is currently based on WebKit, but this is \\r\\nsimply \\u201cmeant as a stopgap until Chromium is ported to Fuchsia.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is a machine learning/context framework baked into Fuchsia, which \\r\\nseems conceptually similar to the existing Google Awareness API.\\r\\n\\r\\nQuestions:\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat happens to the Android Open Source Project and its huge ecosystem of \\r\\npartners?\\r\\n\\r\\nDoes this platform only ship on laptops for its initial release?\\r\\n\\r\\nWill Android Studio be the basis for Andromeda\\u2019s IDE? If so, ouch. IDEs \\r\\nwritten in Java are wildly slow\\u2026\\r\\n\\r\\nWould it actually be possible to use languages other than Dart for UI code, \\r\\nanalogous to UWP\\u2019s support for C# and JavaScript for Windows? At the very \\r\\nleast Dart is the native language for Mojo apps, in the same way that C++ \\r\\nis the real native language of UWP, despite the CLR\\u2019s projections into UWP.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow do you replace the enormous contributions of the Linux kernel and \\r\\nLinaro? It seems like Google will emulate the Linux user space to make its \\r\\nnew OS a tractable effort in the first place, such as by supporting ELF \\r\\nbinaries. But what about existing massive projects, like an Energy Aware \\r\\nScheduler?\\u00a0Or will Google continue to utilize much of its existing Linux \\r\\ncode for now?\\r\\n\\r\\nProgressing the PC\\r\\n\\r\\nI can think of more than a few (read: one hundred) reasons why you would \\r\\nwant to replace Android. I will highlight only one: to completely rewrite \\r\\nthe rendering pipeline. The market for Chrome OS meanwhile is of course \\r\\nmostly limited to education, not to diminish it. Andromeda, however, will \\r\\nprovide a laptop OS with native apps and backwards compatibility with \\r\\nAndroid. It could very well look much the same visually as Chrome OS does \\r\\nnow, however. I also can\\u2019t imagine the Android update problem (a symptom of \\r\\nLinux\\u2019s modularity) won\\u2019t at last be solved by Andromeda, but one can never \\r\\nbe too sure.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe promise of a laptop platform that can bring all the advances of mobile, \\r\\nbereft of the vestiges of PC legacy, while also embracing proven input and \\r\\ninterface paradigms is extremely appealing. And since Apple has only inched \\r\\nmacOS along in recent years despite its decades of cruft and legacy, I \\r\\nwelcome Google\\u2019s efforts wholeheartedly. Hopefully 2017 will finally be the \\r\\nbeginning of the new PC.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u00a0\\r\\n\\r\\nNotes\\r\\n\\r\\n-\\u00a0I am not a programmer, so if anything stated above is incorrect, please, \\r\\nplease send me corrections.
