The plasma helps clot blood and can prevent badly wounded troops from bleeding to death on the battlefield. It saved Army Cpl. Josh Hargis' life. He lost parts of both legs in 2013 when he stepped on a land mine during a midnight raid in Afghanistan. The medic in his Ranger unit used the freeze-dried plasma to keep him alive on the battlefield for more than 90 minutes until he could be evacuated by helicopter.\", \"url\": \"https://apnews.com/593dcb3902ed49a3b1adb97d824505aa\", \"source\": \"associated-press\", \"capturedat\": \"2017-11-30T07:16:56-05:00\", \"publishedAt\": \"2017-11-30T11:39:43Z\", \"title\": \"US troops get freeze-dried plasma for battlefield bloodshed\", \"urlToImage\": \"https://storage.googleapis.com/afs-prod/media/media:28f7d595a9cb4665b2ce426a1bd847d7/3000.jpeg\", \"author\": \"EMERY P.
